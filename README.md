# Write-Upp
### What is Write-Upp?
This is ***merely* a writing space** created after using a lot of online available tools. Every tool I found had one or more downsides: Biggest of all, *paid software*. 
With nothing as readily available and customizable, Write-Upp gives you more control of the space and also provides minimum distractions. This allows for a greater connectivity between keystrokes and your thought process. 

### What is it intended for?
Write-Upp is a tool to create first draft of a story, an article, a poem, a book. anything. If you were to draw any parallel, think of it as **Notepad** but only online, with little more options to it.

### How do I use it?
Write-Upp is created stand-alone, you have a choice to use it via the [URL](https://writeupp.ml) or you have absolute freedom to download it and customize to suit your needs.

### Features
- Multiple fonts
- Background music
- Keystroke sound
- Individual volume customization
- Export to txt file.
- Buttons for basic tasks like copy text, clear area, undo, redo. Thus can be used on mobile phones as well
- Stores data locally after every change so progress is saved preventing data loss

### Customization?
Most basic tasks can be achieved by merely adding/modifying the images/audio files that come with the code. 
For instance, to modify background to something of your own, replace the **bg1.jpg** file located in Images directory with a file of your own **same name**.
To change any audio, follow the same procedure with files in Audio directory, but make sure to have same file name and extension.
For more specific cusomization, refer to variables in **script.js** file. All references are made at the very beginning. 

### Future updates
- Adding a save settings feature to save the customization user makes in cache. Thus eleminating the need for same cusstomization on every session.
- Option to stream music files online instead of default ones.
